===================================================

Copyright Â© 2012-2015, Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.

See [LICENSE.md](<LICENSE.md>) for license terms and conditions.

Use this template as a starting point for an Intel XDK or Apache Cordova hybrid
mobile app. The index.html has the Cordova "deviceready" event code to initialize 
any Cordova plugins that is added to the project.

Project File Information
------------------------

The `icon.png` and `screenshot.png` files are not required by your project. They
are included for use by the Intel XDK template/demo panel and have no use within
a real app. You can safely delete them from your project directory.

The `cordova.js` script is needed to provide your app with access to Cordova
APIs. To add Cordova APIs to your application you must add the corresponding
Cordova plugins. See the *Plugins* section on the **Projects** tab.
